        To be real i just read somehwere in order to grow as a tech guy, you just have to build the biggest possible product with what you learnt. So i just learned how to work with the API with Node axios so i just used openrouter free APi service, initially thought about perplexity.ai api, nut now i don't have it. So I tried to make some 90's space gaming UI with JS,css, html and it worked(almost).
