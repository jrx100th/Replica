It is possible to determine a person's approximate location based on their IP address, but with notable limitations:
Country-level accuracy is very high (typically 95–99% correct).
City-level accuracy is less reliable, around 50–90%, and often only accurate to nearby metropolitan areas—not a street or building.
The exact location can be affected by factors such as the use of VPNs or proxies, mobile networks, and dynamic IP allocation by ISPs—these can hide or distort the actual location.

So use this data to get the location and show them the weather for the next few hours just a side quest with weather API to fill out some screen space.
